a) STILL NEED TO PLOT

b) 3 times

c) L(s) should achieve lower sensitivity at low frequencies for the closed loop system since it has higher gain at lower 
frequencies compared to L2(s).

d) 
L1 Gm is -17.2 dB at 52.4 rad/s
L1 Pm is 40.2 deg at 204 rad/s

L2 Gm is 20 dB at 10^3 rad/s
L2 Pm is 68.2 deg at 193 rad/s

e) The upward gain margin for L(s) is 18.1 dB at 897 rad/s.

f) L(s)'s Nyquist diagram encircles the point -1 once while L2(s)'s Nyquist diagram does not encircle it at all.
Since neither the open loop systems of L(s) nor L2(s) have unstable poles, this means that the closed loop 
system of L((s) is not stable while the closed loop system of L2(s) is.
