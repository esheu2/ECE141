a) STILL NEED TO PLOT

b) 3 times

c) L(s) should achieve lower sensitivity at low frequencies for the closed loop system since it has higher gain at lower 
frequencies compared to L2(s).

d) 
L1 Gm is -17.2 dB at 52.4 rad/s
L1 Pm is 40.2 deg at 204 rad/s

L2 Gm is 20 dB at 10^3 rad/s
L2 Pm is 68.2 deg at 193 rad/s

e) The upward gain margin for L(s) is 18.1 dB at 897 rad/s.
